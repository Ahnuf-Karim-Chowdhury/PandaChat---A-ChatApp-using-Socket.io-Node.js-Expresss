## How It Works 🔄

### Backend 🖥️
- **Express.js**:
  - Used to set up the server and serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
  - Handles routing for the application.

- **Node.js**:
  - Provides the foundation for the backend, enabling asynchronous operations and handling client requests.
  
- **Socket.io**:
  - Establishes a WebSocket connection between the client and server.
  - Handles key events such as:
    - **`joinRoom`**: Allows users to join a specific chat room.
    - **`chatMessage`**: Listens for messages from clients and broadcasts them to other users in the room.
    - **`disconnect`**: Tracks when users leave and notifies the remaining participants.

### Frontend 🎨
- Dynamically updates the UI based on server-sent events (e.g., new messages or users joining/leaving a room).
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Messages are appended to the chat window as they arrive.
  - Active user lists and room names are updated dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Tailwind CSS ensures the chat application looks great on any device, with a clean and modern layout.

### Message Flow 📡
1. A user sends a message via the chat form on the frontend.
2. The message is emitted to the server using a `Socket.io` event.
3. The server processes and broadcasts the message to all users in the same room.
4. All clients receive the new message and update their chat windows in real-time.
